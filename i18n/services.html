			<h1 class="theme">Worldwide Procurement</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p>
				We have well established global network of suppliers and if the part requested is not available from our own stock we usually have located the parts within 24 hours through our extensive supplier database.</p> 
<p>In order to facilitate this two dedicated purchasing offices have been set up in China and the UK. These offices have been formed to develop strategic relationships with suppliers around the world. Both offices work in union with our worldwide sales network scouring the regional markets to secure the best possible prices.</p><br/>

<p>We understand though, that when sourcing and buying electronic components it is not always about securing the best possible price - the devices must also be of the highest quality. To get more information about our quality control team and warranty policy please contact us or email sales@py-tech.com</p>
